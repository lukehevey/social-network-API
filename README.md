  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to build an API for a social network application. This API makes it so users can share their thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and add friends. Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM were used for routing and database work. JavaScript is the main and only language used for this application. This project didn't come without challenges, but I was able to get everything figured out after trial and error. I will continue improving my skills with routing and databases. 
  
  
  ## Installation
  In the terminal use the command 'npm intall' to install all of the packages.
  
  
  ## Usage
  Install all packages, seed the data, and then start up the server. This is all done within the terminal.
